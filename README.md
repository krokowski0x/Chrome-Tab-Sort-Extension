# Chrome Tab Sort Extension

Super simple take on Chrome Extension, that sorts your chrome cards by domains' names.

## Brief description

If you often find yourself having dozens of tabs - as I do - this should help you.
This extension sorts your tabs on click by domains' names with one little trick useful for students - it moves pdf's from different domains at the end of the tabs.

### Installation

After cloning this repository you should go to **Chrome** (or any browser of your choice, but it can act weirdly) and go to:

```
chrome://extensions
```

Then, you should enable **Developer Mode**, upload the app to your browser and you're good to go!
Now, every time you have too much tabs, try clicking on the extension icon and hopefully your life would be easier.
